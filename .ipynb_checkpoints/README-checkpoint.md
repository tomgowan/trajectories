# Parcel Trajectories for CM1 and WRF output
All of these Python scripts compute trajectories using the U, V, and W wind components from NWP model output. The script titled 'backwards_trajectories_CM1.ipynb' features the most up-to-date trajectory code. The code was designed to work with terrain-following output. All code was written using CM1 output, but it should work with WRF output with only slight modifications. This code was written because CM1 doees not support the computation of 'online' trajectories with terrain or backwards trajectories. Other scripts feature various ways to initalize, compute, and plot trajectories (some compute forward, backward, from single points, and/or throughout entire domain.
